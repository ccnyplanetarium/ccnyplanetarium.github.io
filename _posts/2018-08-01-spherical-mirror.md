Here's a shot of our spherical mirror system in place. We use a plane mirror to reflect the image back on to the spherical mirror. While it does complicate the set up a little bit, it enables us to keep the projector tucked nicely under the cove, otherwise it would need to be placed on a long cantilever type arm the extends into the room.

The frame was built with extruded T-slot aluminum (1") which turns out to be very fun to work with. It's like legos for grownups almost.
