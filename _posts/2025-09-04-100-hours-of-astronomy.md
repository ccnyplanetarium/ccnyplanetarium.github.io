<p>100 Hours of Astronomy is a yearly global celebration organized by the Office for Astronomy Outreach (OAO) that invites people of all ages and backgrounds to come together and connect with the night sky â€” and with the science that helps us understand it.
</p>
<p>
From vibrant cities to the most remote corners of the world, this event brings astronomy closer to communities everywhere. Through public stargazing, workshops, talks, and hands-on educational activities, 100 Hours of Astronomy sparks curiosity, encourages shared exploration of the cosmos, and invites us all to reflect on our place in the Universe.

### About your visit

We are located in the Marshak Science Building on the City College Campus. The entrance to the building that is currently open is located at approximately 181 Convent Ave. (Though there is no obvious address indicating that). Any CUNY ID will get you in the building without issue, but external community members will likely have to sign in at the front desk. Here is a google map pin: [Google Map to Marshak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8gSHQgDToYDjqosE7) and a map is below. See our [visiting]({{site.baseurl}}/visit/) page for more important details.
