Another rover is set to land today, Feb 18, on Mars. Its future home will be Jezero Crater, an area with features suggesting it was an ancient martian lake.

Here's a quick video showing some of the interesting features in the crater.

### About the author

Dr. Hedberg studied the ancient cosmologies of Ptolemy, Tycho, and Kepler as an undergrad at St. John's College (Santa Fe) as part of the Program's [Mathematics tutorial](https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/classes/mathematics-tutorial), though the college didn't have this [beautiful tool](https://www.sjc.edu/news/armillary-sphere-unveiled-santa-fe-campus) when he attended there. Since then, his work in programming and science visualization sometimes takes delightful detours into the past, present and future.
