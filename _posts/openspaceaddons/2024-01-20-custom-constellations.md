description: You can create your own custom constellation art. Here's how. 
instructions: "Download the asset zip file below. Unzip and place in your user assets folder. (<kbd>user/data/assets/custom-constellations</kbd>). Add the asset by dragging and dropping the file <kbd>custom-constellation-art.asset</kbd> into the window, or by including in a profile. To create your own set, you will need to first gather the images you want to use and put them in the <kbd>img/</kbd> folder that is included. Then you will need to edit the csv file to use your images. The hard part is aligning everything up. To do that you can adjust the scale and rotation of the images in the OpenSpace Gui and then copy those values into the correct columns in the csv data file. Also note, this method was designed to make it easy to do many constellation files automatically. If you are just doing 1 or 2, then there probably are more straightforward, but less automated approaches. "
