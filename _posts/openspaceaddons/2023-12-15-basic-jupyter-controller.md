description: "A basic template to start programmatically capturing frames using a Jupyter Notebook that controls time (or other properties). A simple example would be to show the orbit of earth throughout 1 year exactly by taking a screenshot everyday from Jan 1 to Dec 31 at noon EST. The notebook is based on earlier work provided by the OpenSpace team found here: <a target = '_blank' href='https://github.com/OpenSpace/scripts/tree/master/jupyter-notebooks'>OS Scripts</a>"
instructions: Begin by getting a local installation of Jupyter Notebook server running. Load the example <code>ipynb</code> notebook. Install any needing libraries based on errors. Run the cells individually. The screenshots can then be assembled using a standard video editor.
