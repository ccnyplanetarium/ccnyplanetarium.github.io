caption: Auto toggle night light layers
description: When close the surface, the night layer makes the ground just look all yellow. This event asset will auto toggle the night light layer when the camera has 'reached' the Earth, i.e. when it's near the surface. It will show the night layer again when the camera has receded from the surface.  
instructions: Download the asset zip file below. Unzip and place in your user events folder. (<kbd>user/data/events/toggle_nightlayer</kbd>). Add the asset by dragging and dropping the main file into the window, or by including it in a profile. Now, when you are close to the surface, the low-res glowing yellow ground will be faded away. It will return as you leave the surface (determined by Earth reach setting).
