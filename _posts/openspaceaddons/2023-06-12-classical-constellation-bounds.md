caption: All Sky View of the 48 classical constellations.
description: There were 48 constellations described in Ptolemy's Almagest. Since then, the number of official IAU constellations has increased to 88. Much of the southern skies were not visible to the classical western astronomers, so the stars in those skies wouldn't be mapped and cataloged in their datasets until expeditions to the southern hemisphere were made.
