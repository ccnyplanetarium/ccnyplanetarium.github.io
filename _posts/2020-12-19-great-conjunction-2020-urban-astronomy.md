As I write this, the skies are looking pretty cloudy, so it's likely there won't be any observations of the Great Conjunction from my location tonight. So, instead, here are a few images from the past few days showing how it appears, even the dirtiest of dirty places, NYC.

If you want a chance to see them through a telescope, and are lacking a telescope, then do go check out [The Amateur Astronomers Association of NY](https://www.aaa.org/observing). They are having observing nights for the next few days. If you would be happy with just a naked eye view, then try to find an area with some (doesn't need to be a lot of) open space towards the south west. Just a big intersection might do. Parks are great. Higher ground is always helpful.

### My recent sightings from the neighborhood.

### About the author

Dr. Hedberg studied the ancient cosmologies of Ptolemy, Tycho, and Kepler as an undergrad at St. John's College (Santa Fe) as part of the Program's [Mathematics tutorial](https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/classes/mathematics-tutorial), though the college didn't have this [beautiful tool](https://www.sjc.edu/news/armillary-sphere-unveiled-santa-fe-campus) when he attended there. Since then, his work in programming and science visualization sometimes takes delightful detours into the past, present and future.
