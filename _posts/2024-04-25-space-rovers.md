As we approach the end of our Spring semester, we are delighted to feature a special event: Space Rover - A Cosmic Book Launch. The author, CCNY MFA grad <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.stewartsinclair.com">Stewart Lawrence Sinclair</a>, will share selections from the book as we travel the solar system in our immersive theatre.

We'll dive into the fascinating world of space exploration and more in the context of the little vehicles we dispatch around the solar system to do the things humans find difficult. This event is perfect for space enthusiasts and bookworms of all ages. Don't miss this stellar opportunity to embark on a cosmic journey with us!
