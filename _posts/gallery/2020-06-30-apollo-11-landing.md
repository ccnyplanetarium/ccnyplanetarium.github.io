description: Imagine having to park your brand new car in a tight spot, in 3 dimensions, while only looking out a teeny tiny window, lying on your back, all while knowing that any error will not just result in a small scratch, but certain death and catastrophic failure. During that last few minutes of the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission, Neil Armstrong manually guided the lunar lander to its eventual parking spot on the moon. Shown here is the reconstruction of the final decent on the rocky surface below.
