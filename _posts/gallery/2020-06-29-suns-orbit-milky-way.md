description: Eveyone used to think the sun moved around the earth every day. Then we got smart and realized the Earth was just rotating and we thought the sun was standing still. Then we got smarter and realized that the sun too was moving, around the center of the Milky Way. It takes about 230 millions years for the sun to make on orbit around the entire galaxy. Here are a few of the orbits plotted over the Milky Way.
