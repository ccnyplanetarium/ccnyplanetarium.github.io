description: Venus is similar to Earth in some ways, but very different in others. For example, the two planets are rought the same same size, but Venus rotates much slower than Earth. Usually, taking a timelapse of the night sky on earth for 24 hours would lead to 1 complete rotation of the celestial sphere, around the Pole star (Polaris). On Venus however, the rotation is very slow, and the axis of rotation is different. This image shows about 2 days worth of star trails. Notice how the center of rotation is not Polaris, but a non descript region in the constellation of Draco.
