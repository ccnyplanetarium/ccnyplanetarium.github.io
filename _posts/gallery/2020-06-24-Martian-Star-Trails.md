excerpt: "Can we capture star trails from the surface of Mars?"

description: A timelapse composite image showing star trails from the bottom of a trench on Gale Crater. Mars has a daily rotation rate similar to Earth. Other than the completely alien landscape and different rotational axis, and atmosphere, the result of a star trail image on Mars will be roughly similar to one taken on Earth's surface.
