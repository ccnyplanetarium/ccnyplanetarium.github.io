description: A composite simulation of the June 21, 2020 Eclipse. This eclipse was an annular eclipse meaning from the earth, a very thin ring of the sun is visible around the moon, the so called Ring of Fire. This image shows about 5 hours worth of the eclipse's shadow as it crosses Africa and Asia.
