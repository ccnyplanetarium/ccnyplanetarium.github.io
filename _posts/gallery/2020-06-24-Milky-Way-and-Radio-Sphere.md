description: The Milky Way Galaxy is a big place. Our corner is rather small. Depicted here, in the green sphere on the lower left, is our <i>Radio Sphere</i>. This sphere represents the spatial extent that radio waves (i.e. TV/radio/cell phone signals) might have traveled away from our planet. It's pretty large compared to Earth, but pretty small compared to the grand scheme of things.
