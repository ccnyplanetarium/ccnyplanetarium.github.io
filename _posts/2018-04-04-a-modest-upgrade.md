## Installing a new projection system

We will be installing a spherical mirror projection system over the existing Spitz 512 instrument. The spherical mirror system will allow us to show digital media on the dome, without a major overhaul of the infrastructure.

The basic concept is that you can redirect a projector's beam to the entire surface of the dome using a hemispherical mirror.

The following schematic shows the idea.

Our installation will require another planar mirror so that the projector doesn't have to be cantilevered out into the middle of the dome.

We will also make some improvements to the audio systems in the room. 

Hopefully, it all goes swimmingly!
