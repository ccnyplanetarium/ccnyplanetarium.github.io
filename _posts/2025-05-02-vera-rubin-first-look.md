### About your visit

We are located in the Marshak Science Building on the City College Campus. The entrance to the building that is currently open is located at approximately 160 Convent Ave. (Though there is no obvious address indicating that). Any CUNY ID will get you in the building without issue, but external community members will likely have to sign in at the front desk. Here is a google map pin: [Google Map to Marshak](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8gSHQgDToYDjqosE7) and a map is below. See our [visiting]({{site.baseurl}}/visit/) page for more important details.
