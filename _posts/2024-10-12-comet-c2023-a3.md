## Viewing the Comet in NYC

We haven't seen it yet, but chances are looking good that we'll be able to see a naked eye comet in the next few days and weeks. Here are a few simulated views showing the path of the comet over NYC. We've stylized the view for fun. 

<div class="row">
<figure class="figure float-md-left col-md-12" style="max-width: 800px;">
   <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/c2023/c2023-over-nyc-stacked.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Comet C/2023 over NYC, vintage style" />
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">A stylized schematic showing the comets path over NYC in the coming days. </figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

<div class="row">
<p>If you want to see the comet, here's the best recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set your alarm for about 30 minutes after sunset each night. (That's going to be around 6:40 or so.) We find forgetting to go look is the most common reason for missing a astronomical event!</li>
<li>Get to a place where you can see as much of the western sky as possible. This could be a roof of a tall building, or perhaps somewhere near the Hudson River.</li>
<li>Look above the horizon in the direction where the sun just set. That's right about straight west this time of year.</li>
<li>Look for a fuzzy thing. Maybe use binoculars, (after the sun has set!!!) to see the comet better.</li>


</ol>

<div class="row">
<p>Here is an animated version showing the path of the comet throughout the night sky. </p>

The above simulations (yes, these are not real photos) were made with [OpenSpace Astrovisualization Software](https://www.openspaceproject.com). 

Good luck.
