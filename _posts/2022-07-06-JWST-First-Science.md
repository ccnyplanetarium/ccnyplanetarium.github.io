## First Images

Come join us on July 12th, in the dome to watch NASA & ESA release the first science images from the James Webb Space Telescope.

We'll stream the broadcast live to the dome starting at 10:30. (Doors open at 10:00)

It will be kid friendly, so feel free to bring your little ones. (Bring your own snacks!)
