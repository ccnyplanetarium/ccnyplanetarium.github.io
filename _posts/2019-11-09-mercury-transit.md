On Monday, the 11th of November, at about 7:35 AM EST, the planet Mercury will begin to pass in front of the sun. We'll try to view this rare celestial occurrence using the physics department's solar telescope. The transit is expected to last for about 5 hours - although clouds are also expected at some point in the morning on Monday. We'll try to be set up and ready to view the transit at 7:30 AM, somewhere between the NAC and the Marshak Buildings (might have to move around to keep a view of the sun so look out for the group with the telescope).
