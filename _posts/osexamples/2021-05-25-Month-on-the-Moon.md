description: What would it look like if you took a picture of the Earth every 24 hours from the surface of the moon? Something like this. Notice how the Earth goes through phases, Full, Half, New, etc. The big difference is that its position in the sky doesn't change all that much over the 28 days. This is because the Moon is tidally locked to always have one face (more or less) pointed towards the Earth.
