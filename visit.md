## Directions

We are located in the basement of the Marshak Science Building (Map below!), on the City College of New York's Hamilton Heights Campus.

#### By Car:

The official address of the Marshak building is 181 Convent Ave. However, Convent is closed to through traffic during the day. You'll want to park elsewhere and walk to campus. 

#### By Subway:

Take the C or B train to 135 and walk straight up the middle of St. Nicholas Park until you get to St. Nicholas Terrace, then turn right. (A lot of stairs)

Take the A/C/B/D to 125 or 145 and walk to CCNY campus (about 10 minutes)

Take the 1 train to 137 St - City College and walk east on 138th until you get to the college campus, then proceed to the Marshak Science Building
