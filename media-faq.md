## FAQ

#### Can I post your content to our social media pages?

In general, no. Our media is not currently licensed for free distribution. You are always welcome to share our posts using legal means, like retweets, or share to stories on IG, but using a 3rd party downloader and then reposting to your own account, even with proper credit, is not permitted.

#### Can I use them in my classes?

Please get in touch and we can figure something out.

#### Why can't I post your videos to my channel?

We have spent years developing these and prefer to be the sole distributor at this point in time. Also, it runs agains the community guidelines for sites like Instagram. Your account should represent you and your contributions to science outreach. There are plenty of tools you can use to make your own videos. Also, since our topics are often scientific and we use data and tools with certain attribution requirements, we need to respect the original work. Often, less serious sites have posted our material without the necessary credits and acknowledgements. This then reflects poorly on all invovled.
