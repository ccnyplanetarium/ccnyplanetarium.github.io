As promised, the little bear bumbles in today. Ursa Minor (and the Little Dipper) are a lot like The Great Bear and Big Dipper, but smaller. It likewise dates to ancient times, and likewise has a comically long tail. What can we do.

At the very tip of that tail is the star known as Polaris, or the North Star. The Earth's axis of rotation point almost exactly at this star. If you record the sky turning for a few hours, you'd see something like this, with the pole star staying nearly still at the center.

However, this will not always be the case. Ever so slowly, the earth's axis is changing its orientation w.r.t the fixed stars. Here we see how the position of the "Pole Star" will change during the next 8000 years of axial precession. It happens with tops too, just a lot faster.
