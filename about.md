## About The Planetarium

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pano-view.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The CCNY Planetarium is one of three found on the island in Manhattan (The AMNH and The Lower East Side Girls Club both have one as well.) It is currently undergoing minor upgrades and repairs and we hope to have shows again, real soon!
